# Learn CSS Garden
Learn CSS Garden is inspired by the well-known project, [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/). When I wrote my article [Same HTML, different CSS](https://ishadeed.com/article/same-html-different-css/), I noticed that people are interested in the concept and it reminds them of Zen Garden.

I got inspired by that and decided to make a similar project, but on a component-level.

## How to Participate
Simply, choose an HTML markup that you like, or suggest one, and work on a unique design for it without changing the HTML markup. Please take the points below into consideration:
- The design should be responsive.
- Using modern CSS features is highly recommended (Grid, flex.. etc).
- Please consider adding [CSS Reset](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) to your CSS.

## How to Submit
Create a new issue on this repository and attach the CSS code, with the challenge name. If all is good, it will be added to the challenge page. It's that simple!
